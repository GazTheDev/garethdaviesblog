<p>To see in the new year I am going to build a functional forum using just PHP, HTML JS and CSS. No fancy React or frameworks. 

The image below shows the rough technical aspects of the website. I did forget to add however, the CSS framework will be bootstrap 4.

The website will be following the latest standards and once built I will release online for everyone to see, I will then work on the frontend code - tweaking design. The idea
of the project is to work on my backend skill, not my frontend. I have CSS templates I can use for this. 

I'm aiming to have this done by tomorrow. It will then be released on a shared hosting account under a old domain I have laying around. 

I'm looking very forward to it and seeing what I can accomplish. If it doesn't work then I will post the results anyway, it's about learning, not building a robust website. 

Anyway, wish me luck!
