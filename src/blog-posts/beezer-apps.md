I made a web app! 
<p>
Hello, welcome back to my blog. In the last few weeks I've been planning and developing my own mobile app or Progressive Web App ( PWA ). I found Beezer was best suited to my needs for it's efficent UI and easy to use without needing to spend hours coding.

For those who watch Dragon's Den in the UK you might have heard of Beezer. They won investment recently and it was brought to my attention. I used them to develop the Coggeshall United web application but at the current point the club was not at a point for actually using it. We did however get feedback to work on in the future. 

Anyway, I've been using Beezer for my own personal use - I created an application to allow me to connect with my users on mobile. It's still a work in progress but so far I'm very happy with the results. It allows me to add features such as Stripe and WordPress, Not that my websites are built using WP but nice to have!. 

The core beezer website builder uses a "react" style component system. Which for me is awesome. it's just  plug and play. However, it does come at a cost. Beezer will set you back between £9.99 for a starter plan and £19.99 for a Accelerate plan. But in fairness it's not to much to say if you was to hire a developer to create the same kind of app. 
<br />

I also really hope they will soon support custom domains. The domain is .beezer which isn't so bad but Ideally I'd like to use my own .tech domain. Maybe this can be added in the future?. 

In conclusion I really like this application builder. It saves me time and money to develop my own applications for clients.
