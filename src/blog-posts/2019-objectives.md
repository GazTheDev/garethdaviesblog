Hi everyone, welcome back to my blog. 

So far, I have had some really positive feedback on my blog which is very much appreciated. In my last post I talked about a PHP challenge which I am still developing due to a few unforeseen issues arising!. Today, I am going to write about my goals for 2019 because, well, it is important to have goals! Goals are something that you can work towards when times are tough. 
I have three main targets which I WILL achieve by December 2019 - 

1. Turnover of Â£1,000 p/m on my business. 
Most people do not like talking about money and neither do I. However, it is something I need to talk about even at this early stage in the life of my business. I am currently still brainstorming ideas about products I could sell online. I already have got a good idea about the services I want to offer: Web Programming, Web Design and WordPress managing. I would also like to get more involved in video making but this will come later!

2. Take 1,000 pictures by December 
Last year, as part of my work with Modus Operandi Sports, I obtained the use of a professional DSLR camera and I really only use it for video work. I have taken some fantastic stills but it has never really been my scene. However, I love looking at pictures and I really think I could take 1,000 good pictures this year. I aim to go out once a week and go for a walk somewhere, take the camera and just see what happens! I have also planned some trips up to the city and abroad as these will be good opportunities for me to take many more interesting pictures. 

3. Learn New Skills 
Such a cliche! However, I really am determined to spend less time procrastinating and more time learning. I am currently doing a course on ReactJS and how to use it with Firebase (Google's database service) but really I want to look to learn about anything that I find whatever I come across what I find interesting. 

2019 looks to be a positive year with so much amazing stuff happening for everyone. Now I just need to push on!

Let me know YOUR targets on Twitter and keep me posted on how your year is going :):
