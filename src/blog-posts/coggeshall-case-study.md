Coggeshall United - Website Case Study. 

In today's blogpost we are going to take a look at our most recent case, Coggeshall United Football Club. Coggeshall United approached us around June 2018 and asked us to develop the club’s website and the media for all of the club’s official matches.

The problem:
</h1>
 Build a functional website for the football club, attract visitors both to the website and to the club on match days and to generally develop the club’s standing within both the local and wider footballing community.

<h1>
The Solution:
</h1>
From the outset, we had issues. Originally, we hand crafted the website using PHP and MySQL. However, due to limitations with the hosting already in place, we were unable to immediately complete a successful build. To resolve the issue, we settled upon using the WordPress CMS. As the season has progressed, we have worked on the website even further, adding accounts, forums, downloads and even an e-Programme to make the club a twenty-first century trendsetter! 

However, despite all these many positives for the football club, we noticed a massive slowdown with regard to the operation of the website. The main reason for these problems was largely due to more and more content being uploaded into the website which was attracting approximately 2,000 hits per month, BUT it eventually got to the point that the website crashed. 

Nevertheless, we were still able to move things forward with both a new website design and backend for that website. We settled on GatsbyJS, a static site generator based on both React and JS. We found a starter and got coding. Our final product is the website that you will see today which is fast, responsive and up-to-date. In addition, the blogposts were brought in using GraphQL with no DB like WP and images loading because of the CDN (Content Delivery Network ). 

Along with creating the website, we also decided that it would be beneficial to film the club’s matches and make them available, both in their entirety and in highlights packages. At first we started filming interviews with our phones, however, this changed once a DSLR camera was obtained. We now use this camera for recording all of our match footage. It is a D3300, it does the job and records 1080p 60fps. 
With each game, the club grows!
